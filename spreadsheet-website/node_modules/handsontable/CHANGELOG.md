### Changed
- Changed how `manualRowMove` and `manualColumnMove` plugins work [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- Click on a row header will select all cells (also hidden). [#2391](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/2391)
- Extracted Cell-Meta logic from Core to separate module. [#6254](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6254)
- The `CellMeta` manager was refactored for future features and improvements. [#6233](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6233)
- Rows can be resized to less than `rowHeights`. [#6149](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6149)
- Left mouse button (LMB) click on the corner will now select all cells. [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- The right mouse button (`RMB`) click on the corner, column and row headers will show just some options, defined by newly created specification [#7082](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/7082)
- Hidden indexes will no longer be rendered, as a consequence `afterRenderer`, `modifyColWidth`, `beforeStretchingColumnWidth` will be executable only on visible (meaning, rendered) rows and columns. [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- The `getColWidth` for hidden index will return 0 - it used to return 0.1 [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- The `modifyColWidth` hook isn't called internally. However, it will be executed when the user will call the `getColWidth`. [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- Hidden rows/columns won't rendered anymore. As a consequence hooks `beforeValueRender`, `beforeRenderer`, `afterRenderer`, `modifyColWidth`, `beforeStretchingColumnWidth` etc. will be executed just for some of the columns (just the renderable ones). [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547)
- Selection behavior changed when hiding cells from the `ContextMenu`, now it is selecting a column on the right when there is space on right to the last selected column, selecting a column on the left otherwise. [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable#6547)
- Developed a unified way to identify HOT "input" elements. All input elements owned by HOT got an attribute "data-hot-input" which are identified by that key. [#6383](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6383)
- `NestedHeaders` plugin was rewritten, from now on, only a tree-like structure will be allowed, meaning, there will be no possibility to place nested headers in-between layers. [#6716](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6716)
- `CustomBorders` plugin was adapted to work with `HiddenColumns` properly, from now on hiding cells at the start or at the end of a range will also hide their borders. Also, hiding a single cell with borders will hide all of its borders. [#7083](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/7083)
- `CollapsibleColumns` will no longer use `HiddenColumns` plugin to work. [#6204](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issue/6204)
- Modifying the table's data by reference and calling `render()` will not work properly anymore. From this point onward, all the data-related operations need to be performed using the API methods, such as `populateFromArray` or `setDataAtCell`. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- Removed dependencies between plugins: the `manualColumnFreeze` plugin doesn't use the `manualColumnMove`, the `collapsibleColumns` plugin doesn't use the `hiddenColumns` plugin, `nestedRows` plugin doesn't use the `trimRows` plugin, `filters` plugin doesn't use the `trimRows` plugin anymore. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945) along with other adjustments [#6547](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6547):
- The `minSpareRows` and `minRows` options will ensure that the number of visible rows corresponds to the value provided to them (for example, the `trimRows` plugin won't have an impact on the number of displayed rows). [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- `toPhysicalRow` and `toVisualColumn` now return `null` for non-existant rows/columns. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- The `afterLoadData` hook receives a different set of arguments. It used to be just the initialLoad flag, now the first argument is `sourceData`, followed by `initialLoad`. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- The `manualColumnFreeze` plugin unfreezes the column just after the "line of freeze". [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- The `RecordTranslator` object and the `t` property available in the plugins were removed. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- After-prefixed hooks (`afterLoadData`, `afterFilter`, etc.) are now called just before the `render` call. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- Newly created rows and columns are now placed in the source data in the place calculated from its position in the visual context (they "stick" to their adjacent rows/columns). It also applies to moved rows and columns. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- When the `nestedRows` plugin is `enabled`, moving rows will be possible only using the UI or by calling the `dragRows` method of the `manualRowMove` plugin. [#5945](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/5945)
- The `beforeRowResize`, `afterRowResize`, `beforeColumnResize`, `afterColumnResize` hooks have the order of their arguments rearranged for the sake of consistency with other hooks. [#3328](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/3328)
- Changed the argument structure in `collapsibleColumns`' `toggleCollapsibleSection` method. [#6193](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6193)
- Updated the `moment`, `numbro` and `pikaday` dependencies to their latest versions. [#6610](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6610)
- Standardize the `z-index` properties between the overlays. [#6269](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/6269)

### Deprecated
- `HeaderTooltips` plugin becomes deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. [#7023](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/7023)
