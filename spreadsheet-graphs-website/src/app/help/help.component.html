  <h3>Getting Started/Website Commands:</h3>
  <ul>
    <h5>Spreadsheet Help:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click on a cell and drag the blue square on the bottom right of the cell
        downwards in order to add new rows (similar to Excel autofill).
      </li>
      <li>
        Right click on a cell to display a context menu for a list of possible
        interactions with the cell. You can also toggle a dropdown menu for each
        column in the table by clicking on the triangle-shaped button in each
        table column header.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press control-z or command-z to undo recent changes to the spreadsheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can choose a curve straightening option below the first spreadsheet
        to select how you want to manipulate your raw data into processed data.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Note that processed data will be graphed in the "graphs" part of this
          website.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h5>Graphs Help:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can use the "Show Graph" button to display a graph of the
        <strong>processed</strong>
        data table.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To display the raw data in the graph, you can choose the curve
          straightening transformation of plotting "x" as a function of "y" (the
          transformation that leaves the raw data unchanged in the processed
          data table).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        We can use the buttons to the right of the graph to toggle the display
        of the trendlines and uncertainties.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Note that the min and max gradients need uncertainties to be
          calculated properly, so the min/max gradients will not be shown if the
          view for the uncertainties are toggled off.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Things To Note:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Note that the minimum number of rows for this data table is 5.</li>
    <li>
      Creating a processed data table for the first time may take ~30 seconds to
      complete as the API that processes the data tables needs to take some time
      to start up.
    </li>
  </ul>
