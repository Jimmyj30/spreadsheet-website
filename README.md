My first coding project....

I wanted to try using HTML and JavaScript to make a web page that is similar to Microsoft Excel and is geared towards basic analysis of data (such as for high school science labs). This project will be a work in progress for the forseeable future as I add features to it that I might find interesting--I might get to learn more about coding web pages along the way!
